<h1>Hi there</ h1>
<h3>I'm a researcher studying the process chemistry of porous nanomaterials</ h3>

<p>
I study the ways in which porous materials are synthesized to ease the transition towards manufacture and widespread realisation of their benefits. 
Particularly, I'm interested in exploring how unusual behaviour of chemicals trapped within pore spaces complicates scale-up and how understanding fundamental physical chemistry at the pore surface can resolve these.
