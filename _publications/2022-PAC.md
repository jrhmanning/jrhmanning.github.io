The aggregation of polycyclic aromatic compound (PAC) molecules is sensitive to the solvent they are dissolved or suspended in. By using both dynamic light scattering and diffusion-ordered nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, in combination with molecular dynamics simulations, the effect of chemical structure on the aggregation of PACs in both aromatic and alkane solvents were systematically investigated. A suite of triphenylene-based PACs offers a robust platform to understand the driving forces of aggregation mechanism across both nanometer and micrometer scales. Both the configuration, either parallel or otherwise, and the arrangement, whether compact or loose, of molecules in their aggregates are determined by a fine balance of different interactions such as those between the polar groups, π–π interactions between the aromatic cores, steric hindrance induced by the side chains, and the degree of solvation. These results suggest that molecular architecture is the major factor in determining how the model compounds aggregate. The shift from aromatic to aliphatic solvent only slightly increases the likelihood of aggregation for the model compounds studied while subtle differences in molecular architecture can have a significant impact on the aggregation characteristics.
