We present an open source Python 3 library aimed at practitioners of molecular simulation, especially Monte Carlo simulation. The aims of the library are to facilitate the generation of simulation data for a wide range of problems; and to support data analysis methods which enable one to make the most of previously generated data. The library contains a framework for automating the task of measuring target physical properties (e.g. density) over a range of thermodynamic parameters (e.g. temperature) calculated using a molecular simulation program, in particular the Monte Carlo program DL_MONTE. The library also supports analysis methods including block averaging, equilibration detection and histogram reweighting. Here we describe the library and provide examples to demonstrate its key functionality: we use the library to automatically calculate isotherms to a specified precision; and to calculate the surface tension and liquid-vapour coexistence properties of methane.
