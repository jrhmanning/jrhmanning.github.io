Inorganic nanomaterials are widely used in e.g. healthcare, electronics and energy sectors (worth several billion $), but their manufacturing is highly wasteful and hence unsustainable. This review highlights the key reasons that make these manufacturing routes unsustainable. We present alternatives, with special emphasis on bottom-up techniques. Biological and bioinspired routes feature as emerging solutions that can be sustainable yet with the ability to produce high-value nanomaterials. Finally, the review identifies future challenges in developing these routes such that they become commercially attractive manufacturing methods.
